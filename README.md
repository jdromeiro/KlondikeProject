## Feedback from reviewers
Very good project overall, with a good application of the OO concepts seen in course and exercise sessions. 
A few points were lost mostly for details. For instance, the code can be sometimes simplified (Deck class, arrays of piles in Board.java, ViewableByKlondike interface; you can ask for the detailed feedback for more details on these matters). 
The way constants from the library are used should also be improved, as changing the constants of the library would likely lead to the misbehaviour of the program. 
Beside these light issues, this is a very good piece of work.
